            Admission is largely based on merits, a proven academic success, the potential contributions a student can
            bring to the community, and an enthusiasm for learning. We enroll students every year to fulfil the vacant
            seats available on merit base. Admission shall not be denied because of nationality, ethnicity, gender, or
            religious beliefs.

                We integrate both the traditional formal exam system with modern thematic evaluation procedure through assessing
                individual performances. A series of class evaluations, observation of behavioral changes, performances in
                thematic assignments will be recorded and made available in the individual roster both manual and electronic
                forms for the parents. Every progress will be updated and parents can access to it in the school website through
                the Unique ID number provided at the time of admission. The report cards of the studentsâ€™ progress will be sent
                after each formal exam. The result of the final exam conducted at the end of the academic session and the
                internal evaluations made throughout the year determine the upgrading of the child.
